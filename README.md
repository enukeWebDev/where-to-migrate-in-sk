This repository will provide some vital information when deciding where to migrate in Saskatchewan. Simply click the markers on the map and there will be a pop up that contains vital information. Data for this project was collected from different sources in the internet including Statistics Canada.

The markers on the map are of different colors. Every colors represents the crime rate of each City. There is a separate function to identify each color for the crime rate.

This is a simple application of what I've learned so far in Python.
